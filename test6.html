                  Just like with any other activity, the world of coding is also 
                    governed by informal rules. Most of these rules are formulated over decades.
                      Programming languages often remain in usage for longer than their founders expect.

                    Web development refers to the process of creating and maintaining websites 
                    and web applications. It involves various tasks such as web design, 
                    web programming, server-side scripting, 
                    client-side scripting, and database management.
